```

## Adding Assets

### 1. Question Databases

Questions should be in CSV or JSON format:

**CSV Format:**
```csv
id,exam_type,subject,difficulty,year,question_text,image_url,options,answer,explanation
1,ENEM,Mathematics,Easy,2023,"What is 2+2?","","A|B|C|D","A","Because 2+2 equals 4"
```

**JSON Format:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "exam_type": "ENEM",
  "subject": "Mathematics",
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "year": 2023,
  "question_text": "What is 2+2?",
  "image_url": "image_url_or_path",
  "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Because 2+2 equals 4"
}
```

**Location:** `assets/questions/{exam_type}/{subject}/`

### 2. AI Models

TensorFlow Lite models (.tflite files):
- Must be quantized to reduce size
- Should include metadata documentation

```

### Step 3: Create Asset List
Update `assets/README.md` with:
- Asset name
- File size
- Description
- Date added

### Step 4: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add ENEM mathematics questions 2023-2024"
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## Quality Standards

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Files are in correct directories
- [ ] File names are descriptive
- [ ] No sensitive information included
- [ ] Files are optimized (images compressed, etc.)
- [ ] Checksums match for verification
- [ ] Documentation is complete

### Asset Requirements

**Questions:**
- [ ] Complete metadata (exam, subject, difficulty, year)
- [ ] Clear question text
- [ ] Correct answer marked
- [ ] Explanation provided
- [ ] References included if applicable

**Models:**
- [ ] Quantized (not full precision)
- [ ] Tested on target devices
- [ ] Documentation included
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

**Images:**
- [ ] Optimized for mobile

## Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**
   - File size validation
   - Format checking
   - Duplicate detection

2. **Manual Review**
   - Content quality
   - Accuracy verification
   - Asset organization

3. **Approval**
   - Merges to main branch
   - Triggers automatic release

## Release Cycle

When your PR is merged:
1. GitHub Actions automatically packages assets
2. Creates a new release (v${RUN_NUMBER})
3. Generates SHA256 checksums
4. Makes files available for download

Users can then access new assets:
- Automatically in the app
- Manually from releases page
